## Why write this program in Shell instead of `x`?

While having a proper compiled binary seems advantageous for this program,
I felt as if writing it in shell would be much more appropriate. This is due
to much easier customizability, easier utilization of built in commands, and
due to the project being as portable as possible-- although the script isn't
as POSIX compliant as I would like it to be.

## Why is this written with bash syntax instead of `x` syntax?

When I first wrote this script, I simply just wanted to practice using bash commands to output a custom
prompt every time I started up my terminal. Since I utilized alot of bash's syntax in this program, rewriting
it to be POSIX compliant would take some time which is something I don't really have at the moment. However 
small changes over time will eventually make this script as portable as possible for as many users as possible.

## Why GNUcoreutils instead of `x`?

Read response above.

## Will this be rewritten into another language?

Already in the works, but will be posted as a fork of this project.
